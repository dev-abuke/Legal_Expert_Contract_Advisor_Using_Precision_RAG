Accordingly, each Seller hereby severally agrees with the Buyer that such Seller, its Affiliates and its and its Affiliate’s Representatives shall not, and that such Seller shall cause its Affiliates and such Representatives not to, at any time on or after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, disclose or use, any confidential information involving or relating to the Business or any Acquired Company (other than in the case of a Seller that is a director, officer or employee of an Acquired Company, in the course of fulfilling his or her duties to the Acquired Companies in such capacity); provided, that the information subject to this Section 6.05(a) will not include (i) any information generally available to, or known by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation hereof by such Seller), (ii) independently developed without reference to such information or (iii) provided by a third party not known to such Seller to be under an obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information; provided, further, that the provisions of this Section 6.05(a) will not prohibit any retention of copies of records or disclosure (A)\\xa0required by any applicable Legal Requirement so long as reasonable prior notice is given to Parent and the Company of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity is afforded Parent and the Company to contest the same, (B) made to the Seller’s legal and/or financial advisors, or (C)\\xa0made in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.  Each Seller agrees that it shall be responsible for any breach or violation of the provisions of this Section 6.05(a) by any of its Affiliates or its or its Affiliates’ Representatives.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto and their respective Representatives may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the Contemplated Transactions and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, all as contemplated by Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(iii). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement limits, restricts or in any other way affects any Seller’s communicating with any Governmental Authority, or communicating with any official or staff person of a Governmental Authority, concerning matters relevant to such Governmental Authority.\\n\\nPublicity.  No public announcement or disclosure (including any general announcement to employees, customers or suppliers) will be made by any party with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions without the prior written consent of the Buyer, the Company and the Sellers’ Representative; provided, that the provisions of this Section 6.06 shall not prohibit any disclosure (a) required by any applicable Legal Requirements (in which case the disclosing party will provide the other parties with the opportunity to review and comment in advance of such disclosure), (b) made in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, (c) by any party (or any Affiliate or member thereof) as part of such party’s (or its Affiliate’s or member’s) ordinary course reporting or review procedures or (d) by a Party to its Representatives, investors or prospective investors. Without limiting the foregoing,  the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, following the public announcement of the Closing, institutional Company Securityholders shall be permitted to list, attach, append, refer to or otherwise use details of the names of the Acquired Companies, the nature of the Business, the existence of the Contemplated Transactions and identity of Buyer, and the fact of such Company Securityholders’ investment in the Acquired Companies in or to any marketing or publicity material (including on the website of such Company Securityholders).\\n\\nRelease. As a material inducement to the Buyer to enter into this Agreement, effective as of the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself, himself or herself; its, his or her past, present and future officers, directors, managers, equityholders, subsidiaries and other Affiliates; and each of their respective beneficiaries, heirs, dependents, Representatives, agents, predecessors, successors and assigns (collectively, the “Releasing Parties”) agrees not to sue, and fully releases and discharges the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and each of their respective directors, officers, assigns and successors, past and present (collectively, the “Releasees”), with respect to and from any and all claims, demands, rights, liens, contracts, covenants, actions, causes of action, obligations, debts, and losses of whatever kind or nature in law, equity or otherwise, whether now known or unknown, and whether or not concealed or hidden, all of which such Seller now own or hold or have at any time owned or held against the Releasees relating to or arising out of the operation or ownership of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.04 will be deemed to constitute a release by such Seller of any right to Compensation or any right to enforce their respective rights under this Agreement. It is the intention of each Seller that such release be effective as a bar to each and every claim, demand and cause of action hereinabove specified, except with respect to any right of such Seller to Compensation or any right to enforce their respective rights under this Agreement. In furtherance of this intention, each Seller hereby expressly waives, effective as of the Closing and subject to the exceptions set forth in this Section 6.07, any and all rights and benefits conferred upon such party by the provisions of applicable Legal Requirement, and expressly consents that this release will be given full force and effect according to each and all of its express terms and provisions, including those related to unknown and unsuspected claims, demands and causes of action, if any, as those relating to any other claims, demands and causes of action hereinabove specified, but only to the extent such section is applicable to releases such as this \\u200eSection 6.07.\\n\\nNonsolicitation. \\n\\n[Reserved]  \\n\\nFor a period of 12 months from and after the Closing Date (the “Restricted Period”), the Sellers shall not, and shall not permit, cause or encourage any of their Affiliates to, (i) solicit, lure or entice away, or in any other manner persuade or attempt to persuade, any Person who is an employee or consultant of any of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date to leave the employ of, or otherwise terminate or diminish his or her relationship with, any Acquired Company, provided, however, that this Agreement shall not prohibit soliciting the employment of any such individual whose employment has been terminated by the Acquired Companies; and provided, further, that the placement of advertisements in newspapers, online job boards, journals or other general circulations not directed or targeted to any such individual shall not constitute solicitation for purposes of this Section 6.08; or (ii) solicit or encourage any Person who is or has been a customer, vendor, supplier, or other business partner of any Acquired Company (each, a “Business Partner”), or any prospective Business Partner, as of the Closing Date to terminate or diminish its, his or her relationship with the Acquired Companies.  \\n\\nIf the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section 6.08 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete or modify specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed. Further, each Seller agrees that, (i) were such Seller to breach any of the covenants contained in this Section 6.08, the damage to the Buyer and the Acquired Companies may be irreparable, (ii) the Buyer, in addition to any other remedies available to it, shall be entitled to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by such Seller of any such covenants together with an award of its reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in enforcing its rights hereunder, (iii) the Restricted Period applicable to a Seller shall be tolled, and shall not run, during the period of any breach by such Seller of this Section 6.08, and (iv) no breach of any provision of this Agreement shall operate to extinguish a Seller’s obligation to comply with this Section 6.05.\\n\\nD&O Tail.  \\n\\nFrom and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Acquired Companies pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the Acquired Companies’ Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof and any indemnification agreement between an Acquired Company, on the one hand, and any of its current or former directors and officers (collectively, the “D&O Indemnitees”), on the other hand, with respect to acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time at or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions).\\n\\nThe Company shall obtain and fully pay the premium for “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies for the benefit of each Person who is currently covered by the Acquired Companies’ directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with an effective date no later than the Closing Date and with levels of coverage, terms and conditions that are at least as favorable to such Person as the directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement. \\n\\nThis Section 6.09 shall survive the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and the Closing Date, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the D&O Indemnitees (or their heirs) and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Acquired Companies.  If the Acquired Companies or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)\\xa0shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)\\xa0shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Acquired Companies shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.09.  Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, cooperate in good faith with the D&O Indemnitees to use the D&O tail policy with respect to claims relating to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing. The obligations of Buyer and the Company (following the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or its successors under this \\u200eSection 6.09 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any D&O Indemnitee (or his or her heirs) without the prior written consent of such D&O Indemnitee (or his or her heirs, as applicable).\\n\\n\\n\\n[Reserved]\\n\\n[Reserved]\\n\\n[Reserved]    \\n\\nFurther Assurances.  From and after the Closing Date, upon the request of either the Sellers’ Representative, the Buyer or any Acquired Company, each of the parties hereto shall do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further acts, assurances, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and other instruments and papers as may be reasonably required or appropriate to carry out the Contemplated Transactions.\\n\\nEmployees and Benefits; Retention Pool\\n\\nTo the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility or vesting under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement (other than any defined benefit pension plan) established or maintained by Buyer or by the Acquired Companies following the Closing Date for the benefit of the Acquired Companies’ employees, such plan, program or arrangement shall credit, to the extent permitted, such Acquired Companies’ employees for service with the Acquired Companies on and prior to the Closing Date, except as would cause a duplication of benefits or coverage for the same period of service.  In addition, for the planned year in which the Closing occurs, with respect to any group health plan established or maintained by Buyer or by the Acquired Companies following the Closing Date for the benefit of Acquired Companies’ employees, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any pre-existing condition exclusions and (ii) provide that any covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any Acquired Companies’ employee or by a covered dependent shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible coinsurance and maximum out of pocket provisions after the Closing Date.\\n\\nBuyer intends to offer each of the employees to be employed by Buyer or remain employees of the Company or the applicable Acquired Company after the Closing on terms that are, as of the Closing Date, no less favorable than the current terms of employment of each such employee.\\n\\nBuyer undertakes to pay or cause the Acquired Companies to pay certain employees identified on Exhibit 6.14(c) the retention bonuses set forth opposite each such employee’s name on Exhibit 6.14(c), in the aggregate amount of the Retention Amount, on terms set forth on Exhibit 6.14(c).\\n\\nParent undertakes to grant to each Vested Optionholder: (i) shares of Common Stock of Parent in such number as set forth opposite such Vested Optionholder’s name on the Allocation Statement. With respect to Vested Optionholders that are employed by the Israeli Subsidiary, such shares shall be granted under the capital gains route pursuant to Section 102; and (ii) options to acquire shares of Common Stock of Parent, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share, which shall vest monthly on a linear basis over a period of 24 months commencing as of the Closing. The number of options to be granted to each Vested Optionholder shall be in equal number (and will be in addition) to the number of shares granted to such Optionholder pursuant to Subsection 6.14(d)(i) above.  With respect to Vested Optionholders that are employed by the Israeli Subsidiary, the shares and options granted under this Section 6.14(d) shall be granted under the capital gains route pursuant to Section 102.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Reserved]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Reserved]\\n\\n\\nTAX MATTERS\\n\\nTax Sharing Agreements.  All Tax sharing agreements or similar Contractual Obligations and all powers of attorney with respect to or involving any Acquired Company are terminated effective as of the date hereof and the Acquired Companies will not be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder.\\n\\nCertain Taxes and Fees.  All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and any conveyance fees or recording charges incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (“Transfer Taxes”) will be timely paid by Sellers when due.  The Sellers’ Representative will, at the expense of the Sellers, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable Legal Requirements, the Buyer will (and will cause their Affiliates to) join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. [internal – I think this is not applicable so I did not make any revisions].\\n\\nCooperation on Tax Matters.  The Buyer, the Acquired Companies, the Sellers’ Representatives and the Sellers will reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the Buyer, the Acquired Companies or the Sellers’ Representatives, in connection with any Tax matters relating to the Acquired Companies (including by the provision of reasonably relevant records or information).\\n\\nStraddle Period Allocation. For all purposes of this Agreement (including the calculation of Accrued Income Taxes), any Taxes of any Acquired Company for any Straddle Period shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period as follows: (i) the amount of any Taxes based upon or measured by income, gain, activities, events, receipts, proceeds, profits or other similar items for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period, respectively, shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business of the day immediately preceding  the Closing Date; and (ii) the amount of Taxes other than those described in clause (i) that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period and the remaining amount of such Taxes shall be allocated to the Post-Closing Tax Period (and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity or controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957 of the Code) shall be deemed to end as of the Closing Date); provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation (other than with respect to property placed in service after the Closing), shall be apportioned on a daily basis and Taxes that are computed on a periodic basis, such as property Taxes shall also be apportioned on a daily basis. \\n\\nIntended U.S. Tax Treatment.

The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that are to be performed after the Closing will survive the Closing in accordance with their terms.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement (including in this \\u200eSection 10.01 or \\u200eSection 10.02) or otherwise to the contrary, nothing will limit or reduce Buyer’s ability to make claims or recover or receive any remedy from any Person with respect to claims arising from fraud committed by such Person.\\n\\nRecourse Limitations.\\n\\n \\n\\nOther than claims arising from fraud committed by the Person, no director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, partner, stockholder, shareholder, Affiliate, parent of, or holder of any equity interest in, any tier, agent, attorney or representative of the Company, Sellers or Buyer (each, a “Non-Party Affiliate”) shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) to any Person for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of (a) this Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby, (b) the negotiation or execution of or performance of any obligation under this Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby, (c) any breach or violation of this Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby or (d) any failure of the Contemplated Transactions to be consummated.

No waiver by any party of any breach or violation of, default under or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, will be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent breach or violation of, default under, or inaccuracy in, any such representation, warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.  No delay or omission on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof.\\n\\nProvisions Concerning the Sellers’ Representative.\\n\\nAppointment.  Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints [●] as the sole and exclusive agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Seller for all purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, with full and exclusive power and authority to act on such Seller’s behalf (the “Sellers’ Representative”).  The appointment of the Sellers’ Representative hereunder is coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable and shall not be affected by the death, incapacity, insolvency, bankruptcy, illness or other inability to act of any Seller.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers’ Representative is hereby authorized, on behalf of the Sellers, to:\\n\\n\\t\\tin connection with the Closing, execute and receive all documents, instruments, certificates, statements and agreements on behalf of and in the name of each Seller necessary to effectuate the Closing and consummate the Contemplated Transactions;\\n\\n\\t\\treceive and give all notices and service of process, make all filings, enter into all Contractual Obligations, make all decisions, bring, prosecute, defend, settle, compromise or otherwise resolve all claims, disputes and Actions, authorize payments in respect of any such claims, disputes or Actions, and take all other actions, in each case, with respect to the matters set forth in Section 2.06, Article VII, Article VIII or any other Actions directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions;\\n\\n\\t\\treceive and give all notices, make all decisions and take all other actions on behalf of the Sellers in connection with the escrow account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, including giving any instructions or authorizations to the Escrow Agent to pay from such escrow account any amounts owed by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Contemplated Transactions;\\n\\n\\t\\texecute and deliver, should it elect to do so in its good faith discretion, on behalf of the Sellers, any amendment to, or waiver of, any term or provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, or any consent, acknowledgment or release relating to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; and\\n\\n\\t\\ttake all other actions permitted or required to be taken by or on behalf of the Sellers under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and exercise any and all rights that the Sellers or the Sellers’ Representative are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.\\n\\nLiability.  The Sellers’ Representative shall not be held liable by any of the Sellers for actions or omissions in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the power and authority of the Sellers’ Representative pursuant to this Agreement, except in the case of the Sellers’ Representative’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.  The Sellers’ Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts that it reasonably determines to be experienced in the matter at issue, and will not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith based on such advice.  Each Seller will severally (and not jointly) indemnify (in accordance with its Pro Rata Percentage) the Sellers’ Representative from any Losses arising out of its serving as the Sellers’ Representative hereunder, except for Losses arising out of or caused by the Sellers’ Representative’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.  The Sellers’ Representative is serving in its capacity as such solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not personally liable in such capacity for any of the obligations of the Sellers hereunder, and the Buyer agrees that it will not look to the personal assets of the Sellers’ Representative, acting in such capacity, for the satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by the Sellers hereunder.\\n\\nReliance on Appointment; Successor Sellers’ Representative.  The Buyer may rely on the appointment and authority of the Sellers’ Representative granted pursuant to this Section 11.04 until receipt of written notice of the appointment of a successor Sellers’ Representative made in accordance with this Section 11.04.  In so doing, the Buyer may rely on any and all actions taken by and decisions of the Sellers’ Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among any of the Sellers or the Sellers’ Representative with respect to any such action or decision without any Liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any Seller, the Sellers’ Representative or any other Person.  Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers’ Representative shall constitute a decision of all the Sellers and shall be final and binding upon each of the Sellers.  At any time after the Closing, with or without cause, by a written instrument that is signed in writing by holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the Sellers (determined by reference to their respective Pro Rata Percentages) and delivered to Parent, the Sellers may remove and designate a successor Sellers’ Representative; provided, that such successor Sellers’ Representative must be reasonably acceptable to Parent.  If the Sellers’ Representative shall at any time resign or otherwise cease to function in its capacity as such for any reason whatsoever, and no successor that is reasonably acceptable to Parent is appointed by such holders of a majority-in-interest of the Sellers within ten (10) Business Days, then Parent shall have the right to appoint another Seller to act as the replacement Sellers’ Representative who shall serve as described in this Agreement and, under such circumstances, the Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any and all actions taken and decisions made by such replacement Sellers’ Representative.\\n\\nEntire Agreement.  This Agreement, together with the other Ancillary Agreements and any documents, instruments and certificates explicitly referred to herein, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto.

No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Parent, the Company and the Sellers’ Representative (acting for all of the Sellers), or in the case of a waiver, by the party (or in the case of any or all of the Sellers, by the Sellers’ Representative) against whom the waiver is to be effective.  No waiver by any party of any breach or violation of, default under or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, will be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent breach or violation of, default under, or inaccuracy in, any such representation, warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.  No delay or omission on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof.\\n\\nProvisions Concerning the Sellers’ Representative.\\n\\nAppointment.  Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints [●] as the sole and exclusive agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Seller for all purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, with full and exclusive power and authority to act on such Seller’s behalf (the “Sellers’ Representative”).  The appointment of the Sellers’ Representative hereunder is coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable and shall not be affected by the death, incapacity, insolvency, bankruptcy, illness or other inability to act of any Seller.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers’ Representative is hereby authorized, on behalf of the Sellers, to:\\n\\n\\t\\tin connection with the Closing, execute and receive all documents, instruments, certificates, statements and agreements on behalf of and in the name of each Seller necessary to effectuate the Closing and consummate the Contemplated Transactions;\\n\\n\\t\\treceive and give all notices and service of process, make all filings, enter into all Contractual Obligations, make all decisions, bring, prosecute, defend, settle, compromise or otherwise resolve all claims, disputes and Actions, authorize payments in respect of any such claims, disputes or Actions, and take all other actions, in each case, with respect to the matters set forth in Section 2.06, Article VII, Article VIII or any other Actions directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions;\\n\\n\\t\\treceive and give all notices, make all decisions and take all other actions on behalf of the Sellers in connection with the escrow account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, including giving any instructions or authorizations to the Escrow Agent to pay from such escrow account any amounts owed by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Contemplated Transactions;\\n\\n\\t\\texecute and deliver, should it elect to do so in its good faith discretion, on behalf of the Sellers, any amendment to, or waiver of, any term or provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, or any consent, acknowledgment or release relating to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; and\\n\\n\\t\\ttake all other actions permitted or required to be taken by or on behalf of the Sellers under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and exercise any and all rights that the Sellers or the Sellers’ Representative are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.\\n\\nLiability.  The Sellers’ Representative shall not be held liable by any of the Sellers for actions or omissions in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the power and authority of the Sellers’ Representative pursuant to this Agreement, except in the case of the Sellers’ Representative’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.  The Sellers’ Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts that it reasonably determines to be experienced in the matter at issue, and will not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith based on such advice.  Each Seller will severally (and not jointly) indemnify (in accordance with its Pro Rata Percentage) the Sellers’ Representative from any Losses arising out of its serving as the Sellers’ Representative hereunder, except for Losses arising out of or caused by the Sellers’ Representative’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.  The Sellers’ Representative is serving in its capacity as such solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not personally liable in such capacity for any of the obligations of the Sellers hereunder, and the Buyer agrees that it will not look to the personal assets of the Sellers’ Representative, acting in such capacity, for the satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by the Sellers hereunder.\\n\\nReliance on Appointment; Successor Sellers’ Representative.  The Buyer may rely on the appointment and authority of the Sellers’ Representative granted pursuant to this Section 11.04 until receipt of written notice of the appointment of a successor Sellers’ Representative made in accordance with this Section 11.04.  In so doing, the Buyer may rely on any and all actions taken by and decisions of the Sellers’ Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among any of the Sellers or the Sellers’ Representative with respect to any such action or decision without any Liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any Seller, the Sellers’ Representative or any other Person.  Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers’ Representative shall constitute a decision of all the Sellers and shall be final and binding upon each of the Sellers.  At any time after the Closing, with or without cause, by a written instrument that is signed in writing by holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the Sellers (determined by reference to their respective Pro Rata Percentages) and delivered to Parent, the Sellers may remove and designate a successor Sellers’ Representative; provided, that such successor Sellers’ Representative must be reasonably acceptable to Parent.  If the Sellers’ Representative shall at any time resign or otherwise cease to function in its capacity as such for any reason whatsoever, and no successor that is reasonably acceptable to Parent is appointed by such holders of a majority-in-interest of the Sellers within ten (10) Business Days, then Parent shall have the right to appoint another Seller to act as the replacement Sellers’ Representative who shall serve as described in this Agreement and, under such circumstances, the Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any and all actions taken and decisions made by such replacement Sellers’ Representative.\\n\\nEntire Agreement.  This Agreement, together with the other Ancillary Agreements and any documents, instruments and certificates explicitly referred to herein, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto.  There are no restrictions, promises, warranties, covenants, or undertakings, other than those expressly provided for herein and therein.\\n\\nCounterparts; Facsimile Signature.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute but one and the same instrument.  This Agreement will become effective when duly executed and delivered by each party hereto.  Counterpart signature pages to this Agreement may be delivered by facsimile or electronic delivery (i.e., by email of a PDF signature page) and each such counterpart signature page will constitute an original for all purposes.\\n\\nSeverability.  Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.  In the event that any provision hereof would, under applicable Legal Requirements, be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, each party hereto intends that such provision will be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with, and possible under, applicable Legal Requirements.\\n\\nGoverning Law.  This Agreement, the rights of the parties hereunder and all Actions arising in whole or in part under or in connection herewith (including any Action based upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the domestic substantive laws of the State of Delaware, including its statute of limitations, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.\\n\\nJurisdiction; Venue; Service of Process.\\n\\nJurisdiction.  Subject to the provisions of Sections 2.06, each of the parties to this Agreement, by its execution hereof, (i) hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts located in Wilmington, Delaware or the courts of the United States located in Wilmington, Delaware for the purpose of any Action among any of the parties relating to or arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) hereby waives to the extent not prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such Action brought in one of the above-named courts should be dismissed on grounds of forum non conveniens, should be transferred or removed to any court other than one of the above-named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some other Action in any other court other than one of the above-named courts or that this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the subject matter hereof or thereof may not be enforced in or by such court and (iii) hereby agrees not to commence any such Action other than before one of the above-named courts.  Notwithstanding the previous sentence a party may commence any Action in a court other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-named courts.\\n\\nVenue.  Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that for any Action among any of the parties relating to or arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, such party shall bring such Action only in the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding the previous sentence a party may commence any Action in a court other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-named courts.  Each party hereto further waives any claim and will not assert that venue should properly lie in any other location within the selected jurisdiction\\n\\nService of Process.  Each party hereby (i) consents to service of process in any Action between the parties arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement in any manner permitted by Delaware law, (ii) agrees that service of process made in accordance with clause (i) or made by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to Section 8.01, will constitute good and valid service of process in any such Action and (iii) waives and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any such Action any claim that service of process made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) does not constitute good and valid service of process.\\n\\nSpecific Performance.  Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated.  Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that, without posting a bond or other undertaking, the other parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any Action instituted in any court of Israel or of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.  Each party further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach or violation, it will not assert that the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.\\n\\nWaiver of Jury Trial.  TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE.  THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND THAT SUCH ACTIONS WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.\\n\\nNo Recourse. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or otherwise, the parties hereto agree on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective Affiliates that this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any action, suit or claim for breach of this Agreement may only be made against, the parties hereto, and no non-party will have any liability relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein or therein.\\n\\nSchedules.

Neither the specification of any Dollar amount or any item or matter in any provision of this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item or matter in any Schedule is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item or matter so specified or included, or other items or matters, are or are not material, and no Party may use the fact of the specification of any such amount or the specification or inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any item or matter not specified in this Agreement or included in any Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

As a material inducement to the Buyer to enter into this Agreement, effective as of the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself, himself or herself; its, his or her past, present and future officers, directors, managers, equityholders, subsidiaries and other Affiliates; and each of their respective beneficiaries, heirs, dependents, Representatives, agents, predecessors, successors and assigns (collectively, the “Releasing Parties”) agrees not to sue, and fully releases and discharges the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and each of their respective directors, officers, assigns and successors, past and present (collectively, the “Releasees”), with respect to and from any and all claims, demands, rights, liens, contracts, covenants, actions, causes of action, obligations, debts, and losses of whatever kind or nature in law, equity or otherwise, whether now known or unknown, and whether or not concealed or hidden, all of which such Seller now own or hold or have at any time owned or held against the Releasees relating to or arising out of the operation or ownership of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.04 will be deemed to constitute a release by such Seller of any right to Compensation or any right to enforce their respective rights under this Agreement. It is the intention of each Seller that such release be effective as a bar to each and every claim, demand and cause of action hereinabove specified, except with respect to any right of such Seller to Compensation or any right to enforce their respective rights under this Agreement. In furtherance of this intention, each Seller hereby expressly waives, effective as of the Closing and subject to the exceptions set forth in this Section 6.07, any and all rights and benefits conferred upon such party by the provisions of applicable Legal Requirement, and expressly consents that this release will be given full force and effect according to each and all of its express terms and provisions, including those related to unknown and unsuspected claims, demands and causes of action, if any, as those relating to any other claims, demands and causes of action hereinabove specified, but only to the extent such section is applicable to releases such as this \\u200eSection 6.07.\\n\\nNonsolicitation. \\n\\n[Reserved]  \\n\\nFor a period of 12 months from and after the Closing Date (the “Restricted Period”), the Sellers shall not, and shall not permit, cause or encourage any of their Affiliates to, (i) solicit, lure or entice away, or in any other manner persuade or attempt to persuade, any Person who is an employee or consultant of any of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date to leave the employ of, or otherwise terminate or diminish his or her relationship with, any Acquired Company, provided, however, that this Agreement shall not prohibit soliciting the employment of any such individual whose employment has been terminated by the Acquired Companies; and provided, further, that the placement of advertisements in newspapers, online job boards, journals or other general circulations not directed or targeted to any such individual shall not constitute solicitation for purposes of this Section 6.08; or (ii) solicit or encourage any Person who is or has been a customer, vendor, supplier, or other business partner of any Acquired Company (each, a “Business Partner”), or any prospective Business Partner, as of the Closing Date to terminate or diminish its, his or her relationship with the Acquired Companies.  \\n\\nIf the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section 6.08 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete or modify specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed. Further, each Seller agrees that, (i) were such Seller to breach any of the covenants contained in this Section 6.08, the damage to the Buyer and the Acquired Companies may be irreparable, (ii) the Buyer, in addition to any other remedies available to it, shall be entitled to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by such Seller of any such covenants together with an award of its reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in enforcing its rights hereunder, (iii) the Restricted Period applicable to a Seller shall be tolled, and shall not run, during the period of any breach by such Seller of this Section 6.08, and (iv) no breach of any provision of this Agreement shall operate to extinguish a Seller’s obligation to comply with this Section 6.05.\\n\\nD&O Tail.  \\n\\nFrom and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Acquired Companies pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the Acquired Companies’ Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof and any indemnification agreement between an Acquired Company, on the one hand, and any of its current or former directors and officers (collectively, the “D&O Indemnitees”), on the other hand, with respect to acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time at or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions).\\n\\nThe Company shall obtain and fully pay the premium for “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies for the benefit of each Person who is currently covered by the Acquired Companies’ directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with an effective date no later than the Closing Date and with levels of coverage, terms and conditions that are at least as favorable to such Person as the directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement. \\n\\nThis Section 6.09 shall survive the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and the Closing Date, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the D&O Indemnitees (or their heirs) and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Acquired Companies.  If the Acquired Companies or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)\\xa0shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)\\xa0shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Acquired Companies shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.09.  Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, cooperate in good faith with the D&O Indemnitees to use the D&O tail policy with respect to claims relating to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing. The obligations of Buyer and the Company (following the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or its successors under this \\u200eSection 6.09 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any D&O Indemnitee (or his or her heirs) without the prior written consent of such D&O Indemnitee (or his or her heirs, as applicable).\\n\\n\\n\\n[Reserved]\\n\\n[Reserved]\\n\\n[Reserved]    \\n\\nFurther Assurances.  From and after the Closing Date, upon the request of either the Sellers’ Representative, the Buyer or any Acquired Company, each of the parties hereto shall do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further acts, assurances, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and other instruments and papers as may be reasonably required or appropriate to carry out the Contemplated Transactions.\\n\\nEmployees and Benefits; Retention Pool\\n\\nTo the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility or vesting under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement (other than any defined benefit pension plan) established or maintained by Buyer or by the Acquired Companies following the Closing Date for the benefit of the Acquired Companies’ employees, such plan, program or arrangement shall credit, to the extent permitted, such Acquired Companies’ employees for service with the Acquired Companies on and prior to the Closing Date, except as would cause a duplication of benefits or coverage for the same period of service.  In addition, for the planned year in which the Closing occurs, with respect to any group health plan established or maintained by Buyer or by the Acquired Companies following the Closing Date for the benefit of Acquired Companies’ employees, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any pre-existing condition exclusions and (ii) provide that any covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any Acquired Companies’ employee or by a covered dependent shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible coinsurance and maximum out of pocket provisions after the Closing Date.\\n\\nBuyer intends to offer each of the employees to be employed by Buyer or remain employees of the Company or the applicable Acquired Company after the Closing on terms that are, as of the Closing Date, no less favorable than the current terms of employment of each such employee.\\n\\nBuyer undertakes to pay or cause the Acquired Companies to pay certain employees identified on Exhibit 6.14(c) the retention bonuses set forth opposite each such employee’s name on Exhibit 6.14(c), in the aggregate amount of the Retention Amount, on terms set forth on Exhibit 6.14(c).\\n\\nParent undertakes to grant to each Vested Optionholder: (i) shares of Common Stock of Parent in such number as set forth opposite such Vested Optionholder’s name on the Allocation Statement. With respect to Vested Optionholders that are employed by the Israeli Subsidiary, such shares shall be granted under the capital gains route pursuant to Section 102; and (ii) options to acquire shares of Common Stock of Parent, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share, which shall vest monthly on a linear basis over a period of 24 months commencing as of the Closing. The number of options to be granted to each Vested Optionholder shall be in equal number (and will be in addition) to the number of shares granted to such Optionholder pursuant to Subsection 6.14(d)(i) above.  With respect to Vested Optionholders that are employed by the Israeli Subsidiary, the shares and options granted under this Section 6.14(d) shall be granted under the capital gains route pursuant to Section 102.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Reserved]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Reserved]\\n\\n\\nTAX MATTERS\\n\\nTax Sharing Agreements.  All Tax sharing agreements or similar Contractual Obligations and all powers of attorney with respect to or involving any Acquired Company are terminated effective as of the date hereof and the Acquired Companies will not be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder.\\n\\nCertain Taxes and Fees.  All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and any conveyance fees or recording charges incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (“Transfer Taxes”) will be timely paid by Sellers when due.  The Sellers’ Representative will, at the expense of the Sellers, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable Legal Requirements, the Buyer will (and will cause their Affiliates to) join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. [internal – I think this is not applicable so I did not make any revisions].\\n\\nCooperation on Tax Matters.  The Buyer, the Acquired Companies, the Sellers’ Representatives and the Sellers will reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the Buyer, the Acquired Companies or the Sellers’ Representatives, in connection with any Tax matters relating to the Acquired Companies (including by the provision of reasonably relevant records or information).\\n\\nStraddle Period Allocation. For all purposes of this Agreement (including the calculation of Accrued Income Taxes), any Taxes of any Acquired Company for any Straddle Period shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period as follows: (i) the amount of any Taxes based upon or measured by income, gain, activities, events, receipts, proceeds, profits or other similar items for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period, respectively, shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business of the day immediately preceding  the Closing Date; and (ii) the amount of Taxes other than those described in clause (i) that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period and the remaining amount of such Taxes shall be allocated to the Post-Closing Tax Period (and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity or controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957 of the Code) shall be deemed to end as of the Closing Date); provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation (other than with respect to property placed in service after the Closing), shall be apportioned on a daily basis and Taxes that are computed on a periodic basis, such as property Taxes shall also be apportioned on a daily basis. \\n\\nIntended U.S. Tax Treatment.

Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints [●] as the sole and exclusive agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Seller for all purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, with full and exclusive power and authority to act on such Seller’s behalf (the “Sellers’ Representative”).  The appointment of the Sellers’ Representative hereunder is coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable and shall not be affected by the death, incapacity, insolvency, bankruptcy, illness or other inability to act of any Seller.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers’ Representative is hereby authorized, on behalf of the Sellers, to:\\n\\n\\t\\tin connection with the Closing, execute and receive all documents, instruments, certificates, statements and agreements on behalf of and in the name of each Seller necessary to effectuate the Closing and consummate the Contemplated Transactions;\\n\\n\\t\\treceive and give all notices and service of process, make all filings, enter into all Contractual Obligations, make all decisions, bring, prosecute, defend, settle, compromise or otherwise resolve all claims, disputes and Actions, authorize payments in respect of any such claims, disputes or Actions, and take all other actions, in each case, with respect to the matters set forth in Section 2.06, Article VII, Article VIII or any other Actions directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions;\\n\\n\\t\\treceive and give all notices, make all decisions and take all other actions on behalf of the Sellers in connection with the escrow account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, including giving any instructions or authorizations to the Escrow Agent to pay from such escrow account any amounts owed by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Contemplated Transactions;\\n\\n\\t\\texecute and deliver, should it elect to do so in its good faith discretion, on behalf of the Sellers, any amendment to, or waiver of, any term or provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, or any consent, acknowledgment or release relating to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; and\\n\\n\\t\\ttake all other actions permitted or required to be taken by or on behalf of the Sellers under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and exercise any and all rights that the Sellers or the Sellers’ Representative are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.\\n\\nLiability.

The Sellers’ Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts that it reasonably determines to be experienced in the matter at issue, and will not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith based on such advice.  Each Seller will severally (and not jointly) indemnify (in accordance with its Pro Rata Percentage) the Sellers’ Representative from any Losses arising out of its serving as the Sellers’ Representative hereunder, except for Losses arising out of or caused by the Sellers’ Representative’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers’ Representative shall constitute a decision of all the Sellers and shall be final and binding upon each of the Sellers.  At any time after the Closing, with or without cause, by a written instrument that is signed in writing by holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the Sellers (determined by reference to their respective Pro Rata Percentages) and delivered to Parent, the Sellers may remove and designate a successor Sellers’ Representative; provided, that such successor Sellers’ Representative must be reasonably acceptable to Parent.  If the Sellers’ Representative shall at any time resign or otherwise cease to function in its capacity as such for any reason whatsoever, and no successor that is reasonably acceptable to Parent is appointed by such holders of a majority-in-interest of the Sellers within ten (10) Business Days, then Parent shall have the right to appoint another Seller to act as the replacement Sellers’ Representative who shall serve as described in this Agreement and, under such circumstances, the Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any and all actions taken and decisions made by such replacement Sellers’ Representative.\\n\\nEntire Agreement.
